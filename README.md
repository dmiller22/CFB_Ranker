# CollegeFootballRanker
College Football computer rankings and simulator

This program pulls scores from Division 1 College Cootball games and uses that to rank each team.

It can also simulate an entire upcoming week as well as any hypothetical matchup. Although it is often successful in picking games
against their Vegas lines, there are many factors this doesn't account for so be hesitant to use it as your sole reason to place a bet.

For any further questions or comments about the program or for permission to use any pieces of code or the program itself,
